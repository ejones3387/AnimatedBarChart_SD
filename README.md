# Using and Animated Bar Chart to Display Crime in San Diego from 1950-2018

## Summary
I currently work at SANDAG (The San Diego Association of Governments) within their crimimal justice department. We are always looking for unique ways to analyze and visualize our data. For this project I decided to use python to build a animated bar chart tracking crime from 1950-2018 in the city of San Diego. This project was completed as the final project for Python Scripting (BDA572) as part of my M.S. in Big Data Analytics at San Diego State University.
